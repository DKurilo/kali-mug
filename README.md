# Kali Linux mug

https://dkurilo.github.io/kali-mug/build/public/  
I just wanted to have a mug with Kali Linux (https://www.kali.org/) logo on it.  
I'm not security specialist, but as any Web developer I soetimes need to make penetration testing for my sites.  
And I need to know about threats.  
So I truly love this Linux distributive. Also it contains gcc by default.  

But now everybody can model a mug he/she wants to have.  

This project are made for standard 11lb mug size and for dye-sublimation paper like TexPrint-R Mug-Size 3.5" x 9.125" (http://www.beaverpaper.com/dye-sublimation_desktop-papers_TexPrint-R-Mug-Size.html)
