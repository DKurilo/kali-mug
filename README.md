# Kali Linux mug

https://dkurilo.github.io/kali-mug/build/public/  
I just wanted to have a mug with Kali Linux (https://www.kali.org/) logo on it.  
I'm not security specialist, but as any Web developer I soetimes need to make penetration testing for my sites.  
And I need to know about threats.  
So I truly love this Linux distributive. Also it contains gcc by default.  

But now everybody can model a mug he/she wants to have.  

This project are made for standard 11lb mug size (about 90mm height and 80mm diameter) and for dye-sublimation paper like TexPrint-R Mug-Size 3.5" x 9.125" (http://www.beaverpaper.com/dye-sublimation_desktop-papers_TexPrint-R-Mug-Size.html)  
This is how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91ZfzzBdWyA

This is the real mug that was produced by some random company:

So to acheive the best result it's better to change the model: sizes and print area.  
But it's still precise enough.
